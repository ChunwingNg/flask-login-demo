# flask-login-demo
Demo of registration and login. Admin interface implemented

This project is to demonstrate a working registration and login system using a local database to store its information.
The passwords that are stored in the database are hashed for security.
An admin user can be created by setting the isAdmin boolean to true in the database for a specific user.
An admin is able to enter an admin index page and can edit the values within the database.
